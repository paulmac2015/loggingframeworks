All of the logging frameworks included in this solution are configured using config files.  Each framework has the capability to be 
configured programattically.  I intend on updating each of them with an example of this capability.  Each framework example
demonstrates logging to the console, text file and event log.  I intend on updating each of them to include logging to a
database example.
